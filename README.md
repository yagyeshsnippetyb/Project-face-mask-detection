# Project-face-mask-detection
This is a basic Face Mask Detection project using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. It checks if a person is wearing a mask through the webcam. I trained a model with images of masked and unmasked faces. It shows the result on screen and gives an alert if no mask is found.
